# Community Content - Microsoft Power BI

This folder contains content introducing Microsoft Power BI and demonstrating various ways in which it can be used to visualize data. The content is divided into three sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Using Microsoft Power BI to Explore and Visualize Data (HOL)

The HOLs may be presented as hands-on labs or as demos accompanying the slide deck.
